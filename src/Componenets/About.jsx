        <h2 className="about-subheading">Our Story</h2>
        <p className="about-text">
          At <strong>CodeXpert</strong>, we recognized a significant gap in
          traditional education—while universities focus heavily on theory, they
          often fall short in teaching the practical, industry-ready skills that
          employers demand. Created by a group of recent engineering graduates who
          faced this challenge firsthand, CodeXpert offers a solution. Our live
          courses provide real-world coding skills and ensure that everyone—
          regardless of their background—can build expertise in programming, with a
          special focus on practical tools and frameworks used in the industry.
